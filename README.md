# Deep Learning with TensorFlow


Deep learning is a method that trains computers to process information in a way that mimics human neural processes. Learn more about deep learning examples and applications in this article.


## What is deep learning?

1. Input layer: Data enters through the input layer.
2. Hidden layers: Hidden layers process and transport data to other layers.
3. Output layer: The final result or prediction is made in the output layer.
