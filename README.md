# Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Pytorch


Deep learning is a method that trains computers to process information in a way that mimics human neural processes. Learn more about deep learning examples and applications in this article.


## What is deep learning?

1. Input layer: Data enters through the input layer.
2. Hidden layers: Hidden layers process and transport data to other layers.
3. Output layer: The final result or prediction is made in the output layer.
## Top Deep Learning Libraries
There are some libraries that are readily available, primarily for performing machine learning and deep learning programming. Some of the most common libraries are as follows: 
1. Keras
   * Developed by Francois Chollet
   * The open-source library is written in Python
2. Theano
   * Developed by the University of Montreal
   * Written in Python
3. TensorFlow 
   * Developed by Google Brain Team
   * Written in C++, Python, and CUDA
4. DL4J
   * Developed by the Skymind engineering team and DeepLearning4J community
   * Written in C++ and Java
5. Torch 
   * Created by Ronan Collobert, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and Clement Farabet
   * Written in Python

# What is Tensorflow:
TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google primarily for deep learning applications. It also supports traditional machine learning. TensorFlow was originally developed for large numerical computations without keeping deep learning in mind. However, it proved to be very useful for deep learning development as well, and therefore Google open-sourced it.

TensorFlow accepts data in the form of multi-dimensional arrays of higher dimensions called tensors. Multi-dimensional arrays are very handy in handling large amounts of data.

TensorFlow works on the basis of data flow graphs that have nodes and edges. As the execution mechanism is in the form of graphs, it is much easier to execute TensorFlow code in a distributed manner across a cluster of computers while using GPUs.

The next part of the What is TensorFlow tutorial focuses on why should we use TensorFlow.

## What is Pytorch:
What is PyTorch?
PyTorch is an open source machine learning (ML) framework based on the Python programming language and the Torch library. Torch is an open source ML library used for creating deep neural networks and is written in the Lua scripting language. It's one of the preferred platforms for deep learning research. The framework is built to speed up the process between research prototyping and deployment.

The PyTorch framework supports over 200 different mathematical operations. PyTorch's popularity continues to rise, as it simplifies the creation of artificial neural network models. PyTorch is mainly used by data scientists for research and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. PyTorch is released under a modified BSD license.

PyTorch was initially an internship project for Adam Paszke, who at the time was a student of Soumith Chintala, one of the developers of Torch. Paszke and several others worked with developers from different universities and companies to test PyTorch. Chintala currently works as a researcher at Meta -- formerly Facebook -- which uses PyTorch as its underlying platform for driving all AI workloads.

## What is OPENCV:
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being an Apache 2 licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.

The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery and establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, etc. OpenCV has more than 47 thousand people of user community and estimated number of downloads exceeding 18 million. The library is used extensively in companies, research groups and by governmental bodies.

Along with well-established companies like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Sony, Honda, Toyota that employ the library, there are many startups such as Applied Minds, VideoSurf, and Zeitera, that make extensive use of OpenCV. OpenCVâ€™s deployed uses span the range from stitching streetview images together, detecting intrusions in surveillance video in Israel, monitoring mine equipment in China, helping robots navigate and pick up objects at Willow Garage, detection of swimming pool drowning accidents in Europe, running interactive art in Spain and New York, checking runways for debris in Turkey, inspecting labels on products in factories around the world on to rapid face detection in Japan.

It has C++, Python, Java and MATLAB interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Android and Mac OS. OpenCV leans mostly towards real-time vision applications and takes advantage of MMX and SSE instructions when available. A full-featured CUDAand OpenCL interfaces are being actively developed right now. There are over 500 algorithms and about 10 times as many functions that compose or support those algorithms. OpenCV is written natively in C++ and has a templated interface that works seamlessly with STL containers.
